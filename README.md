# RP2350-Foxoring-Transmitter
A weak 80 m transmitter for use in "foxoring", i.e. a version of transmitter hunting/fox hunting on th 80 m band where the approximate location of the transmitter is marked on the map. The transmitter uses a Raspeberry Pi Pico 2 to generate the RF signal without any additional circuits, just some filtering and antenna matching. Plus components for convenience, like an LCD and some configuration switches.

The repo contains the source code, the PCB files (gerbers, assembly drawing, BOM, schematics) and 3D models of a suitable box that can clamp onto a Sportident station glass fiber stand.
